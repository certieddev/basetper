🚀 BaseTP

A Minecraft Fabric mod that automatically locates player-built bases and enables high-speed flight-based travel to them, designed for large multiplayer worlds where long-distance movement is tedious.

BaseTP is client-side only and focuses on smooth, efficient traversal while keeping movement behavior stable and consistent.
